a family of 4 humanoid creatures living on earth. The sister lived longer there and knows more about the customs of humans.
Each member has a unique ability, and left off to themselves, the brothers won't survive peacefully and cause problems.
Sister tries to teach them common sense, but teaching is not a skill she masters, losing her patience fast and reacting as she does.
Too bad that her reactions and actions were learned by the brothers, and now think that's the right way to do things on Earth.

Fast forward some time, the young brother becomes a mime and uses his unique ability to make it into an income generating hustle.
He gets a girlfriend, they both love each other. One day she asks him to teach her a trick, which he tries. Forgetting that it was his unique ability that made him so good at it, he gets frustrated when his girlfriend doesn't seem to learn. Remembering his sister's teaching, he rages and starts getting violent, until he finally choked like they used to do in the past. Sadly, he didn't know his strength, and she dies in his hands, choked and eyes turned.

The middle brother is actually smart, and manages to blend in, becoming an advisor due to his brid-eye view of things, being not of the human culture after all. Once he gets invited to a board meeting, where an attendee was keen on creating problems. This attendee was a high-ranking diplomat, not used to being said no or corrected. The brother tries his best to convey the right messages, but keeps getting interrupted by the stupid claims (not questions) of the diplomat. Losing his cool, he confronts him. The confrontation between them rises and the board attendees' efforts to calm the brother weren't succeeding. The brother finally gave in to his memory of his sister's teaching, then leapt to the diplomat, spanking him violently, under the horrified eyes of the board.

The big brother was the one who got beat up the most by the sister. He's a widower now, and kids aren't known to be fast learners...

# Ed Sheeran - Bad Habits

mix of Gantz, Jujutsu Kaisen Shibuya Arc.
vampires roaming the night, eating to thrive and survive. mystery cases. and the story of a vampire to whom the sun does not pose a threat. ignored by the human detectives as it would be impossible for such a vamp to exist. used as a mole, a spy, a mediator.
yet he sees both sides of the coin, both worlds, and will either become hated by both or the piece holding together both.
until this massacre happened.


# League of Legends - The call

war wages for years on end. The strongest weapons being used by the fiercest. These strongest weapons being recycled and passed down have seen it all. But the most interesting is the absolute law that seems to be like an oracle, taking the right decisions upon incomplete facts. Justice is usally served in big matters, but no one knows why. The Judge representing it seems to know everything happening.
But in reality, behind the system of this oracle, it turns out to be 2 more people: the architect and the founder.
The founder is a blacksmith, loving to build things, in his building process, he pours part of his soul into the weapons, thus allowing him to see what is happening all over the world through the weapons. but only interested in building better and more versatile weapons, he doesn't care. the analyst does all the analysis, planning and decisions, and the judge is there to meet and reprense the trio.
As time goes, the weapons are getting better, the founder basing himself on the memory of weapons. the storyteller makes lore to go with the analyst's judgements and the scout puts the weapons in the right places, spreading the right rumours.

together they are secretly making the world go the way they want. 
they choose their stories, their characters, their power building. They are loving it, and when the time comes, they create prochecies.
miracles, and main characters.

but as time goes, fallacies appear. some different opinions, the scout and judge (externals) vs analyst and storyteller (internals)
the founder is neutral as he doesn't care, until a day appeared where the ultimate justice has to be brought.
The law makes itself public and passes down judgement. but humans aren't strong, bu cunning, and they find ways to exploit and destroy the bond. A final human is passed down the final weapon made by the founder, one that can surpass all others, but that would require enormous talent and work. he is given directions and names, and with the help of someone (the scout) appearning random giving more pointers, he manages to progress in his quest.

* so many ways to expand the story:
- a tournament for weaponry
- untold legends and stories of past heroes
- constant improvement to weapons if certain conditions are met
- a good protagonist gone rogue cause of his human nature and becoming antagonist
- a law member (analyst vs storyteller) being secretly an agent for something outwordly
- a protagonist who has to destroy all weapons and collect shards to become stronger
- a game like system to collect shards and merge them into something better 
- scout being like the devil from witcher 3
- a defector of the law
- the origins of the law 
- the system put together by the law 
- the individual ambitions of each member of the law
