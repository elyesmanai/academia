## Google Developer Expert in Machine Learning looking to pursue a Ph.D. in Machine Learning

I went to industry right after graduating from my Masters of Research in Artificial Intelligence where I worked as a consultant with several big firms. I now want to to go back to academia and obtain a Ph.D so I can formally teach in University.

Prior to this, from 2018-2020, I was a a post-doctoral IVADO fellow at University of Montreal and MILA working on fairness-aware sequential decision making under uncertainty with [professor Simon Lacoste-Julien](http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~slacoste/) and [professor Michel Gendreau](https://www.polymtl.ca/expertises/en/gendreau-michel). From 2017-2018, I was a postdoc researcher of the Statistical Relational Learning Group (LINQS) of [professor Lise Getoor](https://getoor.soe.ucsc.edu/home) at the University of California, Santa Cruz. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer science from KU Leuven and Ghent University in 2017 with a dissertation on user modeling in social media under the supervision of [professor Martine de Cock](http://faculty.washington.edu/mdecock/) and [professor Marie-Francine Moens](https://people.cs.kuleuven.be/~sien.moens/). 

I was a visiting scholar at UCLA, University of Washington, Tacoma, Tsinguha University, and Microsoft research, Redmond.
