a family of 4 humanoid creatures living on earth. The sister lived longer there and knows more about the customs of humans.
Each member has a unique ability, and left off to themselves, the brothers won't survive peacefully and cause problems.
Sister tries to teach them common sense, but teaching is not a skill she masters, losing her patience fast and reacting as she does.
Too bad that her reactions and actions were learned by the brothers, and now think that's the right way to do things on Earth.

Fast forward some time, the young brother becomes a mime and uses his unique ability to make it into an income generating hustle.
He gets a girlfriend, they both love each other. One day she asks him to teach her a trick, which he tries. Forgetting that it was his unique ability that made him so good at it, he gets frustrated when his girlfriend doesn't seem to learn. Remembering his sister's teaching, he rages and starts getting violent, until he finally choked like they used to do in the past. Sadly, he didn't know his strength, and she dies in his hands, choked and eyes turned.

The middle brother is actually smart, and manages to blend in, becoming an advisor due to his brid-eye view of things, being not of the human culture after all. Once he gets invited to a board meeting, where an attendee was keen on creating problems. This attendee was a high-ranking diplomat, not used to being said no or corrected. The brother tries his best to convey the right messages, but keeps getting interrupted by the stupid claims (not questions) of the diplomat. Losing his cool, he confronts him. The confrontation between them rises and the board attendees' efforts to calm the brother weren't succeeding. The brother finally gave in to his memory of his sister's teaching, then leapt to the diplomat, spanking him violently, under the horrified eyes of the board.

The big brother was the one who got beat up the most by the sister. He's a widower now, and kids aren't known to be fast learners...
